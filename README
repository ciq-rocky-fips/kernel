SRC-GIT repository for the FIPS kernels.

The actual kernels are maintained in separate branches:

FIPS-8:    Production FIPS kernel for Rocky 8.
           Based on linux-4.18.0-425.13.1.el8_7

FIPS-FT-8: Functional test kernel for Rocky 8.
           Based on linux-4.18.0-425.13.1.el8_7
	   This kernel is only intended for funcitonal testing
	   of the fips functionality and not to be used in production.
	   This branch is a set of 15 commits based ontop of FIPS-8 and is
	   not supposed to be updated manually. Instead it should be rebased
	   ontop of FIPS-8 anytime FIPS-8 changes.

FIPS-9:    Production FIPS kernel for Rocky 9.
           Based on linux-5.14.0-284.30.1.el9_2
